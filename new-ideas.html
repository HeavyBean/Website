        <p class="content">Hello, welcome to my website and my first post. It has been a while since I have done anything website-related. The last time I made a website was during college earlier this year for my Sound Production HND, where I used Wix to showcase all of my college work. This time I want to create a website for <i>me</i> rather than solely for any college work of any kind.
        </p>

        <p class="content">
            This website unlike the last time is made entirely by, you guessed it, <i>me</i>. The HTML, CSS, and JS is all done by these fingers, no more drag and drop website builders where i have to jummp through 20 menus to find the settings I'm looking for. I feel like a professional looking at this IDE even though I have no idea what I am doing and learning as I go along.
        </p>

        <P class="content">
            I hope oyu enjoy looking through my website, and be sure to come back every now and then to keep up with all the changes!
        </P>
